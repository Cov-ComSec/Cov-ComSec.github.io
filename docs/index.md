### New Sessions!
We are now planning to hold drop in session every **Thursday from 15:00-21:00** on [Discord](https://discord.gg/7SF7NKG). In these sessions we hope to complete challenges from [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) and [Try Hack Me](https://tryhackme.com/). We will also aim to play games, like king of the hill (KOTH).
