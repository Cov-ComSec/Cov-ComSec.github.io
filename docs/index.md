# CUEH ComSec Society
Welcome to the website for the Coventry University Ethical Hacking ComSec Society (more commonly known as CUEH ComSec). We are are society lead by three second year students [Jack Orcherton](https://jackorcherton.github.io/), [Martin Schon](https://mschon.dev/) & [Tiago Pascoal](http://bs1phc.me). Here we will share materials used in & related to our presentations.

Currently, we hold weekly meetings on [Discord](https://discord.gg/7SF7NKG). These are every week on **Wednesday from 18:30**.

## Legal
Please note that topics on this site will cover hacking, however this is intended for educational use only & we condem it from being used in any unethical way.

As well as this, do not attack any machine that you do not own, unless you have prior written consent from the owner. As a rule of thumb, if you are unsure if you are allowed to do something, you probably aren't! We would like to take this time to remind you of the [Computer Misuse Act 1990](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/contents) or your local equivilent.

Finally, we accept no responsibility for any actions that you may take following our guides.
