Briefly, the PATH is a system variable unique to UNIX systems which defines the hierarchy that the CPU uses to find executable binaries. If someone were to prepend or append a valid directory to the PATH, then the CPU would consider it as a valid location to find binaries in. Similarly, log files can be used as a vector for code execution if the permissions were to be misconfigured.</description></item><item><title>SQL Injection</title><link>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_sqli/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 12:40:28 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_sqli/</guid><description>SQL Injection Further on today, we will be using THM If you haven&amp;rsquo;t registered go to tryhackme.com Ensure you have the VPN file or AttackBox ready SQL Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to communicate with databases and has the capability to delete, edit, insert or retrieve data.

I will try to cover most of the methods we can use to get through Jack&rsquo;s cat and Ben&rsquo;s secure passwords. Without further ado, let&rsquo;s begin.
Challenge 1: Web Username The first one was very tricky for me as I am not a cat person and don&rsquo;t enjoy cat pictures&hellip; Anyway, as we go to the landing page, we can see that there are home(1) and login(2) pages and some information(3) about some employees.]]></description></item><item><title>Introduction, Recon &amp; OSINT Taster Session</title><link>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_taster_session/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 20:14:41 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_taster_session/</guid><description>Welcome back to our first official session for the new academic year, it was great to finally meet you all in real life.
