The Three Kings have received a prophecy about the birth of God&amp;rsquo;s son in twelve days’ time!
Unfortunately, King Herald has also heard this news and has ordered the death of all babies within his kingdom. Since King Herald has many spies, we have had to enclose hidden information within this letter.
Can you help the three Kings reach God&amp;rsquo;s son and ensure his safety? To do this, each day there will be three daily challenges to complete for the next 12 days (starting 26th December) with varying difficulties aimed at a range of abilities.</description></item><item><title>Guest - 0verfl0w_ - Banking Malware</title><link>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/bankingmalware_overfl0w/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2020 12:40:28 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/bankingmalware_overfl0w/</guid><description>This week we had a talk by a second-year student, 0verfl0w_ about banking malware and his experience while working as a Principal Security Analyst.
