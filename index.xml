We will run workshops in the labs as much as possible, so those machines will be available. If you&rsquo;re a more experience hacker, you no doubt have your own environment, however, if you&rsquo;re still getting into the area you may want a low-effort environment to start with. ComSec has built some tools to help with this.]]></description></item><item><title>Writeup: Hack The Box Cyber Apocalypse 2023 - The Cursed Mission</title><link>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2023_hackthebox_cyberapoc/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2023 12:40:28 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2023_hackthebox_cyberapoc/</guid><description>The HackTheBox Cyber Apocalypse has become a staple annual event of the ComSec CTF calendar, though this year a couple of changed were introduced - such as the maximum team size and average difficulty of the challenges.

It was the first CTF of the year that ComSec played, we had quite a few new members playing this one so it was a great chance for them to practice their skills.
This article contains writeups of a range of difficulty and category, so this should be a good place for new members to see what a jeopardy style CTF looks like.</description></item><item><title>Log and PATH Poisoning</title><link>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2022_log_and_path_poisoning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2022 21:15:26 +0800</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2022_log_and_path_poisoning/</guid><description>In this session we talked about log files, the PATH variable and how an attacker could exploit them. Briefly, the PATH is a system variable unique to UNIX systems which defines the hierarchy that the CPU uses to find executable binaries. If someone were to prepend or append a valid directory to the PATH, then the CPU would consider it as a valid location to find binaries in. Similarly, log files can be used as a vector for code execution if the permissions were to be misconfigured.</description></item><item><title>SQL Injection</title><link>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_sqli/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 12:40:28 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_sqli/</guid><description>SQL Injection Further on today, we will be using THM If you haven&amp;rsquo;t registered go to tryhackme.com Ensure you have the VPN file or AttackBox ready SQL Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to communicate with databases and has the capability to delete, edit, insert or retrieve data. There are a few variations of SQL which have some slight syntactical differences. A few examples are MySQL, SQL Server and SQLite.</description></item><item><title>Twelvetide CTF</title><link>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_twelvetide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 12:40:28 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_twelvetide/</guid><description>Hi everyone,

I will try to cover most of the methods we can use to get through Jack&rsquo;s cat and Ben&rsquo;s secure passwords. Without further ado, let&rsquo;s begin.
Challenge 1: Web Username The first one was very tricky for me as I am not a cat person and don&rsquo;t enjoy cat pictures&hellip; Anyway, as we go to the landing page, we can see that there are home(1) and login(2) pages and some information(3) about some employees.]]></description></item></channel></rss>
