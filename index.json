The first section of the session covered some foundational theory content on CPU architecture, registers, and memory. After this, assembly was introduced - we used x86_64 assembly with Intel syntax. In this article we will go through one method of solving each assembly challenge. The shellcode solutions will be released at a later date. You can download the presentation here.

First assign values x = 10 y = 5 z = 2 a = 4 Let’s start by push x,y,z,a to the stack. Since the stack is LIFO we should push in reverse order, so that we can access x \u0026 y first. Whilst demoing this in the session, it was pointed out that would could move the values directly into the relevant registers, however we showed it this way because it introduces the concept of interacting with memory. .global _start .intel_syntax noprefix _start: push 4 push 2 push 5 push 10 Next we should pop x and y into registers and multiply them. times: /* 10 * 5 */ pop rdi pop rsi imul rdi, rsi Now we need to divide by z. Remember in assembly the operator of the integer division should be stored in rax, and we call div with the register containing the operand. divide: mov rax, rdi pop rsi div rsi Now we simply need to add a, and exit. add: pop rdx add rax, rdx exit: mov rdi, rax mov rax, 60 syscall We then assembled our code. $ gcc task1.s -o task1.elf -nostdlib -static With this done, we could step through the program with our debugger to see the result of our code. We can see tha value in rax is 0x1d, 29 in decimal, which is the correct answer. We can load the program into gdb, start the program with a breakpoint using starti, and step through the program using n. The context will be printed after each step, and we can call the different context sections. (ie context registers) in case the sections scroll off the page.

We will do 4 ^ 3. So lets get 4 into a register. .global _start .intel_syntax noprefix /* we will do 4 ^ 3*/ _start: xor rax, rax mov rdi, 4 mov rsi, rdi Now we want to build a loop. For the loop, we will build an if statement using a a conditional relative jump. rax is compared to decimal 2, if they are equal then a conditional relative jump is performed to the label done:. Otherwise the program continues to the multiply statement. The value of rax is then increased by 1, and a relative jump is made to the loop: label. loop: cmp rax, 2 je done imul rdi, rsi inc rax jmp loop done: mov rax, 60 syscall We can see that the resulting value, stored in rdi, is 0x40 or decimal 64. This is the correct answer.

The instructions were as follows: Calculate y = x/z If y is odd then exit If y is even, divide again, loop until odd We will use starting values x = 11906 y = 4. Let’s get the those values into registers then. .global _start .intel_syntax noprefix _start: push 4 push 11906 pop rax pop rsi div rsi How do you know if a number is even or odd ? Well in binary, if a number is odd the the least significant bit (LSB) must be 1 (ie 3 = 0011 as 4 bit binary), if it is even then the LSB must not be 1 (ie 2 = 0010 as 4 bit binary). So we can test the value of the LSB to know whether a number is odd of even. We can use a conditional relative jump if the number is odd to the label odd:, which will exit the program. Otherwise divide again and relative jump back to the test: label test: test al, 1 jnz odd Using loops in the same way as task 2, you should now be able to implement the rest of the code yourself.

A network is a group of interconnected computers, which are assigned an IP address. The whole point of scanning a network is to discover which IP addresses are in use across the network (so we can target them in the port scanning phase). There are a few ways to go about this, each with pro’s and con’s: Wire-tap Can be done by plugging a device into the network, or the functionality can be emulated by software like wireshark Records each packet that passes it Main advantage to this method it is quiet, hence useful for red teaming situations Main disadvantage is that it can be slower and miss devices ARP Scan The Address Resolution Protocol is used to find the MAC address of a computer on a local subnet Main advantage of ARP is that it cannot be disabled in IPv4 and you can find out the manufacturer of each device Main disadvantage is that you can only find devices on your local subnet Ping Sweep This sends an ICMP request to every device on the network If there is a response, a machine is at that address As it is a layer 3 protocol, it can reach devices on other subnets (hence finding more) Main disadvantage is that more and more devices will not respond to ping requests (so that they will not be discovered), for example this behaviour is blocked by default in Windows 10.

We have hashed. Now, we can try some brute-forcing. However, this would get us nowhere unless we pay attention to the notes left in the /home/intern/ directory. Efforts to get the boss to give me the credentials for root on this machine haven't been going well. Luckily I have a pretty good idea of what it could be so I can start guessing it. Here is what I know - I know my boss set the password - He has a cat called Collin - He has a daughter called Holly - The password he set for Splunk was h0lly_2001 Now we can use this info and hashcat rules to crack the password. So, if we already have one password we can use it as a template. Let’s begin with the names.

For this purpose, we can use rules. If you are not familiar with hashcat rules, check out their documentation The rules I am going to use to generate the new wordlist are pretty much going to replace symbols like “s” with “$”, “a” with “4”, and so on. That is the content of the file I am going to use: : l u sa4 sa@ sb6 sc\u003c sc{ se3 sg9 si1 si! sl1 so0 sq9 ss5 ss$ st7 st+ sx% sa@sc\u003cse3sl1si1so0ss$ lsa@sc\u003cse3sl1si1so0ss$ usa@sC\u003csE3sL1sI1sO0sS$ sa@sc\u003cse3sl1so0ss$ lsa@sc\u003cse3sl1so0ss$ usa@sC\u003csE3sL1sO0sS$ sa@sc\u003cse3si1so0ss$ lsa@sc\u003cse3si1so0ss$ usa@sC\u003csE3sI1sO0sS$ The command to generate it is: hashcat -r rules names.list --stdout \u003e wordlist.list And once we have generated our new wordlist, we can try brute-forcing the password with a mask attack that is going to look like this: hashcat -m 1800 -a 6 hash.txt wordlist.list ?1?2?3?d?d -1 _- -2 12 -3 90 This mask will append - or _ to the end of each word with folowing all the ears from 1900 to 2099.

Another spelling error can occur due to inconsistencies between American and British spellings - this can then cause code not to function; an example of this is ‘colour’ and ‘color’. Permissions - when running some commands in Linux, you will need to run the command as an administrator (aka Super User). One example of this is you need to have admin permission to run anything on the common ports. Thankfully, this is a quick fix in Linux, and all you need to do is add sudo before the command or if you are using the fancy new Z shell, just type sudo !! and it will automatically run the last command as root. Networking \u0026 VM’s - a common issue when using virtual machines is choosing the right networking mode. If you wish to access the internet; we recommend that you use ‘NAT’ networking but be careful when typing IPs as you now run the risk of scanning the wrong machine (and if you do, you can face legal consequences from the owner). If you are trying to run a network between two VMs, you must ensure that they are both in the same networking mode. Python Version - hackers seem to be increasingly turning to Python to run proof of concepts in Python - but you must ensure that you run it in the right version. Currently, there are two major branches of Python; Python2 (which is now deprecated) and Python3. Unfortunately, Python2 cannot run Python3 code and vice versa, therefore if the code will not run in one version, try it in the other. A quick way to tell the Python version is to look at the print statements; in Python3 print statements look like this print(\"Hello World\") and in Python2 they are as follows print \"hello world\" (notice without brackets). Missing Python Module - if you receive a ‘submodule cannot be found error’, then you probably will need to install it (have a look at using pip).

Many believe that Hi Vis jackets make people look more authoritative and official - therefore they are more likely to listen to them. To prove this point comedian and scientist Eline van der Velden donned a jacket and clipboard; then asked random people to complete ridiculous requests - see the results below. The Milgram Experiment The above was done to prove a point and builds on more historic research. In 1963 Stanley Milgram investigated the difference between obedience and free will. The main reason for this was at the time the Nuremberg War Criminal trials were taking place; and many people argued they carried out genocides as they were just following orders. The experiment worked by attaching someone to an electric shock machine. Then a volunteer had to ask that person questions; if they got one wrong, they would have to administer an electric shock - each one progressively worse. If the volunteer declined, they were told they must by an authoritative figure. In a similar experiment, Milgram repeated it with people wearing uniform - one was with the authoritative figure wearing a grey lab coat and one wearing plain clothes. 20% more people would listen to the person wearing the lab coat.

We have a folder called a anonymous let’s see what’s inside. Hm a file called FTPflag.txt looks like we found the first flag. Good Job! So you have one flag.To be honest this flag works more like a hint to tell you what you should do after this. So if you go back to your nmap scan you will see that you have a line “21/tcp open ftp Pure-ftp” so we have a file transfer protocol it is always good to check as this can sometimes be used for file upload to the machine you are attacking. But what’s the mean of ftp-anonymous if you do a fast google search you will find out that when this happens you can have acces to ftp server without having to know the credentials.So lets try to connect to the ftp. ftp 172.18.0.1 You will be asked to input the Name. You just have to type anonymous to connect. If you do a “ls” you will be able do see the a file called FTPflag.txt which is the same file you found in the website. You type help you will see as the commands that you can use inside the ftp, we want to upload p0wnyshell so that we can get access to the machine through the browser. For now you just need to know that we are using p0wnyshell as our reverse-shell. So “ctrl+c” to stop the ftp connection clone p0wny shell repository P0wny-Shell{target=_blank}. cd p0wny-shell ftp 127.18.0.1 put shell.php The last command is going to upload our shell. If you go back to your browser and back to “/ftp-uploads/anonymous” you will see the file shell.php in there clicked and you will have p0wny-shell.So you succefully entered the machine. Let’s look for the last flag. A easy way to find files on linux is using the file command. find / -name \"*.txt\" 2\u003e/dev/null Congratulations!

We mangled the ports from the StandardPorts sudo nmap -sC -sV 192.168.42.1 -p- In this challenge the ftp part is the same as the first challenge and the first flag is the same, the only difference is that the ports have been changed so if you to “http://192.168.42.1” the website is not going to load you need to instead look for something like this “192.168.42.1:8080”. So lets pass to the second part uploading files to ftp. We have ftp running on port 2121 (2121/tcp ccproxy-ftp) last time you use “ftp $ip” to connect this time that wont work cause you will need to specify the port os instead use something like this “ftp $ip port” ftp 192.168.42.1 2121 Again use anonymous as login. In this challegne we introduced privesc so we will need a scrip to enumerate all te services that are being run on the machine, file permissions, file types, sym links ,etc. There are 2 that are I know, LinEnum and linpeas. I prefer linpeas{target=_blank}, instead of cloning the repository what I did is I open my prefered text editor on my kali box and I just copy/pasted the script. Then I stopped the ftp connection I cd to the directory where I have linpeas, I started the connection again and use the “put linpeas.sh” to copy linpeas to the machine. Besides linpeas we will need a php reverse shell, cause p0wny shell is not going to work in this challenge. Another good resource to put in your bookmarks, PentestMonkeys{target=_blank} I did the same process with both linpeas and the php-reverse-shell{target=_blank} so open your editor and “ctrl+c / ctrl+v” put hte ip of your kali box in the line where you see \"\" \\change this\" and upload the file to the ftp. So right now you should see something like this Which means you ready. Open a terminal and start netcat. nc -lvnp 1234 Go to “192.168.42.1:8080/ftp-uploads/php-reverse-shell.php” the site should be loading for ever. If you go back to your terminal you should have access to the box. Tip: everytime I get a reverse shell I try to find out what user I am. whoami Lets not forget we are in /var/www , we need to copy our linpeas script to tmp folder. cp linpeas.sh /tmp chmod +x linpeas.sh ./linpeash.sh Take a look at the output and try to find the SUID section. If you don’t know SUID is a type of permission that you have on linux that let’s the user run the file or binary. That last line mentioning vim.basic maybe we can do some research and see how we can exploit it. Fortunately there is a good resource called “GTFOBINS”{target=_blank} which is used for looking how we can exploit binaries look for vim and you will see that you can spawn a shell inside vim or using the command. :!/bin/sh #or vim -c ':!/bin/sh' Now you are root! cd /root cat flag.txt Congrats!

The point of this is to be able to identify targets IP addresses and their open ports (from this you can gleam some of the services/software a server uses). The most popular tool to do this is named Nmap. Why Port Scan? First step on most challenges Find programs running on devices Find program versions and find associated vulnerabilities OS detection Easy to do The main disadvantage is that it can be ‘loud’ and detected by IDS/IPS. Types of Scans Due to different types of technologies, there are multiple ways to scan targets, the main ones are described below: TCP Stealth Scan TCP is a connection-oriented method used by most protocols (e.g., SSH, HTTP, HTTPS). It has the following stages known as a handshake: Syn – client device initiates and attempts to establish connection Syn-ack – server acknowledges receipt of syn Ack – client acknowledges receipt of syn-ack, and communication will start Fin – terminates connection A TCP scan uses this to its advantage, it sends a syn packet and if a syn-ack packet is received, the port is open. The connection is then dropped, before the host fully recognises the connection. Ping Scan Sends an ICMP packet to specified hosts, if there is a response, you know it is up. UDP Scan Sends UDP packet, if there is a response it is open, if there is no response it is open or filtered. If the port is unreachable, it is closed. ARP Scan Sends an ARP request and waits for responses. Listening Just listens to network traffic and can detect which devices are communicating.
