# Introduction, Recon & OSINT Taster Session


Welcome back to our first official session for the new academic year, it was great to finally meet you all in real life. This is a quick recap of what we did.

## What is ComSec?
Welcome to ComSec, we are Coventry University's Ethical Hacking Society. We aim to share our knowledge around cybersecurity and to create a strong info-sec community. Our aims:
- Teach cybersecurity
- Organise talks with businesses
- Organise university wide competitions
- Compete internationally with our team ‘Ethical Slackers

## Committee 2021
This year the committee is:
- Ben R (second year)
- Jack Orcherton (third year)
- Martin Schon (placement year)
- Tiago Pascoal (third year)

## Legal & Rules
We teach ethical hacking in the faith that you will only use it for ethical purposes and will abide by the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and all other related laws. We are not lawyers and do not accept any responsibilities for your actions! If you are ever unsure whether an action is illegal; do not do it - as sadly it's impossible to CTRL + Z hacking.

Additionally, as an inclusive society, we are committed to enforcing our [Code of Conduct](https://cov-comsec.github.io/conduct/).

## Getting Involved
To join the society, you do not require any membership and can just turn up to our sessions. Do not worry about attending every session, but note we typically pick the most active people to compete in external competitions.

## Quick Advice
What is the best way to improve? 
- Practice! Below are some great sites:
    - [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/)
    - [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)
    - [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/)
- Keeping up with the latest cybersecurity news.
    - [All InfoSec News](https://allinfosecnews.com/) is nice as it aggregates news stories from multiple sources.

## Today's Challenge
Today we will be completing a boot2root machine, kindly put together by Ben and Jack. It is hosted on CTFd – remember when signing up, use your university address!
Today’s challenge – mainly based on reconnaissance. The more you know, the easier it will be!

Please be respectful of the other CTF players. If you have system access think about what you are doing. Don’t ruin the experience for other players by modifying/deleting files or leaving clues in easy to find places

We hope to include a write-up for the challenge in the upcoming days.
