It was the first CTF of the year that ComSec played, we had quite a few new members playing this one so it was a great chance for them to practice their skills.
This article contains writeups of a range of difficulty and category, so this should be a good place for new members to see what a jeopardy style CTF looks like.</description></item></channel></rss>
