Similarly, log files can be used as a vector for code execution if the permissions were to be misconfigured.</description></item><item><title>SQL Injection</title><link>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_sqli/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 12:40:28 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_sqli/</guid><description>SQL Injection Further on today, we will be using THM If you haven&amp;rsquo;t registered go to tryhackme.com Ensure you have the VPN file or AttackBox ready SQL Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to communicate with databases and has the capability to delete, edit, insert or retrieve data. There are a few variations of SQL which have some slight syntactical differences. A few examples are MySQL, SQL Server and SQLite.</description></item><item><title>Introduction, Recon &amp; OSINT Taster Session</title><link>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_taster_session/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 20:14:41 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_taster_session/</guid><description>Welcome back to our first official session for the new academic year, it was great to finally meet you all in real life. This is a quick recap of what we did.

Good notes, and their importance Making notes with Markdown What is website exploitation? Introduction to OWASP top 10 SQL Injection Sqlmap Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Sensitive Data Exposure Resources Presentation Slides Note Taking Effective hacking requires a thorough and methodological approach. Additionally, in the workplace you will have to report findings to clients and be able to work with others.</description></item></channel></rss>
