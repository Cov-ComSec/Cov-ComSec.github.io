DownUnder CTF was a 48 hour CTF that began on Friday 23rd September 2022. It was the first CTF of the year that ComSec
played, we had quite a few new members playing this one so it was a great chance for them to practice their skills.

This article contains writeups of a range of difficulty and category, so this should be a good place for new members
to see what a jeopardy style CTF looks like.
