To end this academic year, ComSec helped second-year student Alex to run a CTF building inspired hackathon over the weekend of the 20th of March 2021.

The idea was simple, teams had to build a CTF challenge utilising a docker template that we created as a starting point. To find out more information [click here](https://github.com/Cov-ComSec/Build-a-CTF_Event).
