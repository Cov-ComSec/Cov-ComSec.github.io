title: About ComSec
---

Hello and welcome to ComSec, we are Coventry Universityâ€™s unofficial ethical hacking society.

We meet weekly during term-time, typically on Wednesdays, to provide lectures on ethical hacking, invite guest lecturers, compete in tournaments and meeting with businesses in the cybersecurity field.

Currently the CTF teams operate with the aliases 'Ethical Slackers' or 'R0073R5'.


We participate in a number of university CTFs such as [Hack The Box Uni CTF](https://www.hackthebox.com/universities/university-ctf-2021), as well as global CTFs such as the [Cyber Apocalypse](https://www.hackthebox.com/events/cyber-apocalypse-2022) and [DEADFACE](https://ctf.deadface.io/). In 2022 
we ranked 6th in the UK.

We plan to resume ComSec fully again in September 2023. In the meantime, we are always active on our Discord channel, invite links available to Coventry University students.

## Committee

As a society we are fairly open and will allow anyone to run sessions. One of the advantages of not being an official society is no requirement for formal society roles. However, to ensure that the club runs smoothly, ComSec is currently led by the following people:

- Hedvig M
- Agnes Suszter
- Alex S
- Owen Ball


## Want to Join?

If you are a Coventry University student, feel free to get in touch by either searching for 'ComSec' university's active directory.
