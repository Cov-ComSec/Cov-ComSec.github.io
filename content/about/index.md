title: About ComSec
---

Hello and welcome to Comsec, we are Coventry University’s unofficial ethical hacking society.

We meet weekly during term-time, typically on Wednesdays, to provide lectures on ethical hacking, invite guest lecturers, compete in tournaments and meeting with businesses in the cybersecurity field.

Currently the CTF teams operate with the aliases 'Ethical Slackers' or 'R0073R5'. We participate in a number of university CTFs such as [pwnEd](https://pwned.sigint.mx/) (9/45) and the [Hack The Box Uni CTF](https://www.hackthebox.com/universities/university-ctf-2021) (33/594), as well as global CTFs such as picoCTF and RuCTFe.

Below shows ComSec competing in the 2019 RuCTFe, in which our team 'Ethical Slackers' achieved 60th place.

We plan to resume ComSec fully again in September 2021, dates will be confirmed closer to the time to ensure it fits with timetabling. In the meantime, we are always active on our Discord channel. 

## Committee

As a society we are fairly open and will allow anyone to run sessions - as we are all good at different areas. However, to ensure that the club runs smoothly, it is led by the following people:

- Jack Orcherton
- Martin Schon
- Tiago Pascoal
- ***REMOVED***

If you are a Coventry University student, feel free to get in touch by either searching for 'ComSec' or one of our names in the universities email directory.
